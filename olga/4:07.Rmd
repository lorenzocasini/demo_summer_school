## R Functions
object: everything is an object
functions: everything that is happening in R is the result of a function call.

```{r}
n <- 100
u <-runif(n)
n
```

```{r}
?runif
```

## Functions
Function principles:

The value of a function call is uniquely defined by the value of the argument.

The effect of a function call is simply the returned value
