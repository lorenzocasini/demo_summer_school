# Big Header
## Small Header

* an asterisk starts an unordered list
* and this is another item in the list
+ or you can also use the + character
- or the - character

To start an ordered list, write this:

1. this starts a list *with* numbers
2. this will show as number '2.'
33. a wrong number here still shows as number '3.'
#. the '#' continues the list and shows as number '4.'
9. any number or '#' will keep the list going.
    * just indent by 4 spaces (or tab) to make a sub-list
        1. keep indenting for more sub lists
    * here i'm back to the second level

Here are some nice emoji: `r emo::ji('cold_sweat')` `r emo::ji('flushed')` `r emo::ji('scream')`

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
